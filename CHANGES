Bug fixes:

- Made the transforms look for sub-objects in a sub-directory only if such a
  sub-directory exists. The previous implementation had the effect that only
  transforms which had files with images in sub-directories could work.
- Disabled in ooo2sdbk.xsl the management of measure units for images because it
  produced inch in DocBook and it was not useful anyway as of now
